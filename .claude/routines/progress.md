# Progress Log

Append-only. The routine writes here at the end of every run, including failed runs.
Do not reorganize or summarize this file — the raw sequence is the audit trail.

## Codebase Patterns

<!--
Read first on every run. Hard cap: 20 lines. When adding one, prune the least useful.
Only general, reusable knowledge belongs here — not story-specific detail.

Examples of the right kind of line:
- Service objects live in app/services and always return a Result struct
- Migrations are never written by the routine; they are flagged for a human
- Feature specs need the dev server on :3000
-->

- Env setup a fresh clone needs before `bin/verify` works: `bundle install`, then put
  gem exe wrappers on PATH — `export PATH="/opt/rbenv/versions/3.3.6/bin:$PATH"` (else
  `bundle exec rspec/rubocop/packwerk` = "command not found"); start Postgres with
  `pg_ctlcluster 16 main start` and set its pg_hba host lines (127.0.0.1/::1) to `trust`
  (app connects as `postgres` with empty password); run `bin/rails tailwindcss:build`
  (builds/tailwind.css is gitignored) or request specs 500 on the missing asset.
- Convention: every index/collection view guards with `<% if @coll.any? %>` and renders
  `PlatformCore::Ui::EmptyStateComponent` (optional `empty.with_action`) for the zero-case.
- Views compose only `PlatformCore::Ui::*` components + Tailwind tokens; write class
  strings as literals (never interpolate) or the standalone Tailwind build purges them.
- Modules cross boundaries only via `PlatformCore::EventBus` or a sibling's `app/public`
  API; a module references users by id through `PlatformCore::Graph`, never the User model.

Outcome: shipped | failed | blocked | skipped

Learnings:
- <only if genuinely reusable>

## 2026-08-04 — F-002
Outcome: shipped
PR: https://github.com/danecjensen/citysocial/pull/1
Changed: components/restaurants/app/views/restaurants/leaderboard/index.html.erb, spec/requests/restaurants_spec.rb
Notes: Default branch was healthy — the initial `bin/verify` failure was purely
container setup (gem exe wrappers off PATH, Postgres down, tailwind.css unbuilt), not
code; fixed the env, then shipped the leaderboard empty state (the one index view still
missing its zero-case). DanesIdeas inbox was empty; 1b gate was open (0 ready), so seeded
the backlog with F-001 (feed composer, next up at 1.70), F-003 (vote-button a11y), and
F-004 (feed timeline N+1, below threshold at 0.975).
Learnings:
- Env-setup steps promoted to Codebase Patterns above.
